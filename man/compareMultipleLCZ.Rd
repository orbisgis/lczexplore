\title{Compares several sets of geographical classifications, especially Local Climate Zones classifications}
\usage{
compareMultipleLCZ(sfInt, LCZcolumns, sfWf = NULL, trimPerc = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{sfInt}{an sf objects with intersected geometries and the LCZ columns for each workflow LCZ}

\item{LCZcolumns}{a vector which contains, the name of the columns of the classification to compare}

\item{sfWf}{a vector of strings which contains the names of the workflows used to produce the sf objects}

\item{trimPerc}{this parameters indicates which percentile to drop out of the smallest geometries resulting
from the intersection of the original sf geometries intersection.
It allows to account for numeric precision errors and to speed up computations at the cost of not considering the smallest geometries.}
}
\value{
returns graphics of comparison and an object called matConfOut which contains :
matConfLong, a confusion matrix in a longer form,
matConfPlot is a ggplot2 object showing the confusion matrix.
percAgg is the general agreement between the two sets of LCZ, expressed as a percentage of the total area of the study zone
pseudoK is a heuristic estimate of a Cohen's kappa coefficient of agreement between classifications
If saveG is not an empty string, graphics are saved under "saveG.png"
