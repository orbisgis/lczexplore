and load them in a list}
\usage{
loadMultipleSfs(
  dirPath,
  workflowNames = c("osm", "bdt", "iau", "wudapt"),
  location
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dirPath}{is the place where the files are}

\item{workflowNames}{sets the names of workflows}

\item{location}{is the name of the location at which all LCZ are created}
}
\value{
returns graphics of comparison and an object called matConfOut which contains :
matConfLong, a confusion matrix in a longer form,
matConfPlot is a ggplot2 object showing the confusion matrix.
percAgg is the general agreement between the two sets of LCZ, expressed as a percentage of the total area of the study zone
pseudoK is a heuristic estimate of a Cohen's kappa coefficient of agreement between classifications
If saveG is not an empty string, graphics are saved under "saveG.png"
