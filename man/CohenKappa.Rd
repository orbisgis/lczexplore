\title{Compute Cohen's Kappa Coefficient}
\usage{
CohenKappa(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  weights = c("Unweighted", "Equal-Spacing", "Fleiss-Cohen"),
  conf.level = NA,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{can either be a numeric vector or a confusion matrix.
In the latter case x must be a square matrix, in lczexplore,
will take the matrix of agreement weighted by area for all intersected geometries}

\item{y}{not used here, but allows to compute cross table of x and y as an entry}

\item{weights}{either one out of \code{"Unweighted"} (default), \code{"Equal-Spacing"},
\code{"Fleiss-Cohen"}, which will calculate the weights accordingly,
or a user-specified matrix having the same dimensions as x containing the weights for each cell.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level of the interval.
If set to \code{NA} (which is the default) no confidence intervals will be calculated.}

\item{\dots}{further arguments are passed to the function \code{\link{table}},
allowing i.e. to set \code{useNA}. This refers only to the vector interface.}
}
\value{
the value of this pseudoKappa
}
\description{
Compute Cohen's Kappa Coefficient
}
\details{
Taken from descTools
who based it on Kappa from library(vcd)
author: David Meyer
see also: kappa in library(psych)
Integrated here to reduce dependecy to descTools as it is the only function from DescTools we used
Computes the agreement rates Cohen's kappa and weighted kappa and their confidence intervals.

Cohen's kappa is the diagonal sum of the (possibly weighted) relative frequencies, corrected for expected values and standardized by its maximum value. \cr
The equal-spacing weights (see Cicchetti and Allison 1971) are defined by \deqn{1 - \frac{|i - j|}{r - 1}}
\code{r} being the number of columns/rows, and the Fleiss-Cohen weights by \deqn{1 - \frac{(i - j)^2}{(r - 1)^2}}
The latter attaches greater importance to closer disagreements
