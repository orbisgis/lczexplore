\title{Take sf files with an lcz_primary column, and concatenates them in a single sf object,
adding a column for location and workflow names}
\usage{
concatAlocationWorkflows(sfList, location = "location", refCrs = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sfList}{the list of LCZ sf objects}

\item{location}{the name of the location at which all LCZ are created}

\item{refCrs}{a number telling which sf of the sfList will be the reference in termes of Coordinate Reference System}
}
\value{
returns graphics of comparison and an object called matConfOut which contains :
matConfLong, a confusion matrix in a longer form,
matConfPlot is a ggplot2 object showing the confusion matrix.
percAgg is the general agreement between the two sets of LCZ, expressed as a percentage of the total area of the study zone
pseudoK is a heuristic estimate of a Cohen's kappa coefficient of agreement between classifications
If saveG is not an empty string, graphics are saved under "saveG.png"
