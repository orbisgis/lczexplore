\title{In a given list of directories the function looks for LCZ datafiles, return a datasets LCZ values for each geom and workflow}
\usage{
concatAllLocationsAllWfs(
  dirList,
  locations,
  workflowNames = c("osm", "bdt", "iau", "wudapt"),
  missingGeomsWf = "iau",
  refWf = NULL,
  refLCZ = NA,
  residualLCZvalue = NA,
  column = "lcz_primary"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dirList}{the list of directories for which the different LCZ files will be intersected}

\item{locations}{for each diretory from dirList, a location name must be fed to the function}

\item{workflowNames}{sets the names of workflows and define the name of the files which will be loaded and intersected}

\item{missingGeomsWf}{the name of the workflow where some areas were not classified}

\item{refWf}{the name of the workflow one uses as a reference to complete the incomplete workflow.
if NULL then the geometries added will get the level specified in residualLCZvalue, else, the level in refLCZ}

\item{refLCZ}{the reference level the completed geometries will receive}

\item{residualLCZvalue}{the value the completed geometries where the reference workflow does not classify
the geometry with refLCZ level}

\item{column}{a parameter to feed addMissingRSUs function}
}
\value{
returns graphics of comparison and an object called matConfOut which contains :
matConfLong, a confusion matrix in a longer form,
matConfPlot is a ggplot2 object showing the confusion matrix.
percAgg is the general agreement between the two sets of LCZ, expressed as a percentage of the total area of the study zone
pseudoK is a heuristic estimate of a Cohen's kappa coefficient of agreement between classifications
If saveG is not an empty string, graphics are saved under "saveG.png"
