\title{Computes the agreement between geographical (LCZ) classifications on a range of values of
an indicator of confidence granted to each LCZ classification.

\arguments{
\item{inputDf}{is an R file with geom IDs, (LCZ) classifications and
a confidence value granted for the (LCZ) classifications values of each geom. Ignored if filePath is not empty.}

\item{filePath}{is the path to a csv file containing geom IDs, LCZ classifications and
a confidence value granted for the LCZ value of each geom. Set it to "" if inputDf is specified (recommanded)}

\item{nPoints}{is the number of points (quantiles) of confidence for which
the average agreement between classifications will be computed}

\item{wf1}{is the name of the workflow used to produce the first LCZ}

\item{wf2}{is the name of the workflow used to produce the second LCZ}

\item{geomID1}{is the name of the column that contains the geom ID associated to the first workflow}

\item{column1}{is the name of the column storing the first LCZ classification values}

\item{confid1}{is the name of the column storing the first LCZ classification confidence value}

\item{geomID2}{is the name of the column that contains the geom ID associated to the second workflow}

\item{column2}{is the name of the column storing the second LCZ classification values}

\item{confid2}{is the name of the column storing the second LCZ classification confidence value}

\item{sep}{the separator used if filePath is not empty}

\item{repr}{is standard when original LCZ values are expected, alter otherwise}

\item{plot}{if TRUE the graph is plotted}

\item{saveG}{if not an empty string, specifies where to save graphs}
}
\value{
returns an object called output, which contains the values of the thresholds
for the confidence value and the agreement between classifications for the LCZ levels presents in the dataset
}
