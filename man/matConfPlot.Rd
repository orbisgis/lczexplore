\title{Plots a tile graph of a confusion matrix between two sets of lcz on the same area}
\usage{
matConfPlot(
  matConfLong,
  column1 = "lcz_primary",
  column2 = "lcz_primary.1",
  marginAreas = NULL,
  agreeColumn = "agreePercArea",
  wf1 = "reference",
  wf2 = "alternative"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matConfLong}{is a dataframe for the matrice of confusion/agreement, in the longform :
first column is the LCZ level of the first workflow, second the level of the second workflow and
the third column the percentage of surface of the level of the first classification classified in the level of
the second classification}

\item{column1}{is the name of the first classification}

\item{column2}{is the name of the second classification}

\item{marginAreas}{are the percentage of areas for LCZ types for both workflows (an output of matConfLCZ)}

\item{agreeColumn}{is the name where the agreement between classification is stored}

\item{wf1}{is the name of the first workflow (for labels)}

\item{wf2}{is the name of the second workflow (for labels)}
}
\value{
returns a plot of a matrice of confusion
}
\description{
Plots a tile graph of a confusion matrix between two sets of lcz on the same area
}
\details{
Most of the time this function will not be called directly
by the user but by the compareLCZ function
