\title{Intersect multiple sf files in which Local Climate Zones are set for polygon geometries}
\usage{
createIntersect(
  sfList,
  columns,
  refCrs = NULL,
  sfWf = NULL,
  minZeroArea = 1e-04
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sfList}{a list which contains the classifications to compare, as sf objects}

\item{columns}{a vector which contains, for each sf of sfList, the name of the column of the classification to compare}

\item{refCrs}{a number which indicates which sf object from sfList will provide the CRS in which all the sf objects will be projected before comparison
By defautl it is set to an empty string and no ID is loaded.}

\item{sfWf}{a vector of strings which contains the names of the workflows used to produce the sf objects}

\item{minZeroArea}{all geometries smaller than this value are discarded (avoids numeric precision problems)}
}
\value{
an sf file with values of LCZ from all the input
are assigned to geometries resulting from intersection of all input geometries
}
