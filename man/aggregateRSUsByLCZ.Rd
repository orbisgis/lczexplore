\title{For an sf object containing LCZ types, aggregates touching geometries with same value of LCZ}
\usage{
aggregateRSUsByLCZ(
  sf,
  aggregateBufferSize = 0,
  LCZcolumn,
  wfColumn,
  locationColumn = "location"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sf}{contains the geometry and LCZ levels}

\item{aggregateBufferSize}{is the size of a buffer you can add to the geometries before agregation.
Useful when you suspect numeric precision to create false disjunction of geometries.}

\item{LCZcolumn}{the name of the column coontaining LCZ types}

\item{wfColumn}{is the column where the workflow used to produce lcz is precised.}

\item{locationColumn}{is the name of the column where the location is stored}
}
\value{
an sf object containing the agregated geometries, their LCZ types and the wf and location columns
if present in the initial sf
}
\description{
For an sf object containing LCZ types, aggregates touching geometries with same value of LCZ
